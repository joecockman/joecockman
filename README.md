# Welcome to my Github Portfolio 👋

I am an aspiring data analyst who recently completed a 12 week data analytics bootcamp and I am now looking to land my first job in this field.

The purpose of this profile is to serve as a portfolio of data projects I have created using Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, SQL & Python.

Please see below some previews of projects I've completed and click the links for detailed information on how I put them together.

## My Projects

- [Sports Analytics Database](https://github.com/yourusername/sports-analytics-database): An SQL-based project analyzing an imaginary football league I created, the ELFL.
  
- [Spotify Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-analytics-dashboard): A Tableau dashboard for analysing Spotify streaming data.
  
- [Air Quality Visualization](https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-visualization): A Power BI dashboard for analysing air quality data by pollutant.
