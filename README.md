# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github Portfolio

I am an aspiring data analyst who recently completed a 12 week data analytics bootcamp and I am now looking to land my first job in this field.

The purpose of this profile is to serve as a portfolio of data projects I have created using Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, SQL & Python.

Please see below some previews of projects I've completed and click the links for detailed information on how I put them together.
