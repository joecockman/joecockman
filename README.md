## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am an aspiring data analyst who recently completed a 12 week data analytics bootcamp and I am now looking to land my first job in this field.

## The purpose of this profile is to serve as a portfolio of data projects I have created using Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau & SQL.

Please see below some previews of projects I've completed and click into the relevant repository for detailed information on how I put it together.
